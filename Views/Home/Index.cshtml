            Around 1.4 million New York City households own a car, and the total population sits at more than 8.6 million. Add to this the more than 178,000 people who visited
            every day in 2018 and you’ve got a recipe for high car accident rates. Many people wonder how true the rumors are about the frequency of someone being involved in an NYC car accident.
